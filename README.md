Save a record of what you have done and what you have been feeling everyday all in one place. Diaryme is a diary-like application allowing you to record simple parts of their day-to-day life and organize them like diary entries. 

**Diaryme presentsâ€¦**

**Mood of the day** - choose a prominent emotion that you have been feeling all day. Enter a log every day to collect a sunset themed mood board on your monthly calendar.

**What a day** -  a list of activities and events that you have partaken in today. The list is endless (though with a limit of 10 activities each day)! You can add any activities that you have done throughout the day by entering it in the textbox.

**Snap of memories** - moments that made your day. Add a photo of a point in the day that you want to remember. You can also write about the photo and attach the location of this special memory.

**Towards a better me** - reflect on your day. At the end of the day, reflect on the ups and downs that you have been through. Jot down the laughs and cries that you have shared with your friends and family to remember them fondly down the road.

**A line of random-ness** - quotes by famous or unknown people are shared to spark or inspire you throughout your journey with diaryme.
